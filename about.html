  <p>Before I started this class I used to go to the gym in the morning. I like to start my day by working out, and I like all the older folks who are at the gym at 7am.</p>
<p>
  Because class is at 9:30, I don't feel like I have enough time to go to the gym before class. I don't like being rushed before classes and I don't want to be too tired. 
</p>
<p>
  Now I go to the gym after class. I don't like it as much because I don't know the people in the afternoons, and honestly they aren't as nice as the older people.

  <h3>Playing Tennis</h3>
  <p>I have been playing sports competitively since I was a child. I started with soccer, which I will always love, and then picked up tennis. In between I did gymnastics and basketball.</p>
  <p>I picked up tennis about 10 years ago, which isn't that long in the grand scheme of tennis playing. I played throughout highschool and in college for my school. College athletics are hard and I almost quit a few times, but I ened up sticking through it. </p>
  <p>Now, I like to play with my friends casually. Most of my friends are not that good, so it is really easy and relaxed to play, although I do miss the intensity sometimes. I have also picked up pickleball, which is fun but not as much of a workout as tennis.</p>

  <p>I am no film bro, but I definitely enjoy watching movies and tv shows.</p>
  <p> Some of my favorite movies include Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Bend it Like Beckham, Past Lives, and Surf's Up(you can't deny that it's a masterpiece). While I mostly enjoy light hearted movies, I do enjoy a good drama.</p>
  <p>I have only recently got into watching movies, but I have always been a big fan of tv shows. Some of my favorites are The Bear, Derry Girls,Fleabag, and New Girl. </p>
  <p> When I'm not doing any of these things, I enjoy spending time with my friends and family.</p>
